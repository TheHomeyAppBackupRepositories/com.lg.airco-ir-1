Connect your LG Air conditioning to Homey.

LG Heat pumps and HVAC systems are among the top in the market for efficiency and design. Enjoy fresh air at the right temperature in your home for your optimal indoor climate.

This app allows Homey Bridge and Homey Pro to control LG AC units via Infrared, so you can control and automate them in the Homey app. Homey Pro or Homey Bridge need to be in te same room as your AC system, as infrared signals to not travel through walls.

Note: LG has several types of air conditioning systems, using different remote commands. The most popular types are available in this app, and we expect to add more variants in the future. Please try which type (1/2/3) works with your AC unit. If you want to provide feedback on supported units, you can do so via our support form.
